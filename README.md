# RosProjects
All the 5 tasks are available
For task 3, an example of the roslaunch command to be used is :
$ roslaunch task_3 driver.launch args1:="2.0" args2:="2.0" args3:="3.0"
args 1 is the radius, args 2 and args3 are the x and y target coordinates respectively!
Playing the rosbag recordings for task 1 and 4 will not give a proper result due to the latency issues of the recordings! If the nodes are run seperately, the performance will be proper!
The text files will be written in the hidden .ros folder in the home directory!
